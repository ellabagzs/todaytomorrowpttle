we drew a dove as a symbol for peace because us humans are like doves. 
<br>
the bad weather refers to as the problems and struggles that we 
<br>
experience not just in this pandemic but also on a regular basis. 
<br>
and we symbolize the dove because no matter how hard the rain is,
<br>
the dove waits in its nest until the sun will shine again.
<br>
and just like us we find solutions to our problems until we are able
<br>
to solve them. </font></center>
